Protein Pathway Analyzer

A Tkinter-based interactive tool for visualizing and analyzing protein structures as graphs.

This project allows users to input an amino acid sequence, visualize it as a circular protein graph, detect misfolds/cycles, insert random misfold edges, and animate the minimum-energy pathway between residues. It also provides detailed amino acid information on click.

Features

Custom Sequence Input: Enter any valid amino acid sequence and generate the corresponding protein graph.

Graph Visualization: Displays residues as circular nodes with edges representing the protein backbone or misfold connections.

Animated Shortest-Energy Path: Highlights the minimum-energy path dynamically and keeps the path permanently highlighted after animation.

Cycle Detection: Detects potential misfolds in the protein graph.

Interactive Node Inspection: Click on any node to view amino acid properties (name, type, charge).

Misfold Simulation: Insert random edges to simulate potential misfolding or unusual connections.

Responsive UI: Graph layout adapts to window resizing.

Color-Coded Nodes and Edges: Easily distinguish normal residues, misfold edges, and highlighted paths.

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/protein-pathway-analyzer.git
cd protein-pathway-analyzer


Install Python dependencies:

This project only uses Pythonâ€™s standard library (tkinter, random, math, heapq, collections), so no additional packages are required.

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed with Tkinter support.

Run the application:

python protein_pathway_analyzer.py

Usage

Launch the application.

Enter your amino acid sequence (e.g., ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY) in the entry field.

Click Build Graph to generate the protein structure.

Use the buttons to:

Insert Misfold Edge

Detect Cycles

Animate Shortest Energy Path

Reset the graph

Click any node to view detailed amino acid properties in the status bar.
